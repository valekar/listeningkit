# AGENTS.md

Conventions for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) and human contributors.

This file is cross-cutting only. Each top-level app owns its own conventions:

- [apps/core/AGENTS.md](apps/core/AGENTS.md): Django backend (models, services, auth, plugins)
- [apps/cli/AGENTS.md](apps/cli/AGENTS.md): `magpie` CLI (Typer + httpx + Pydantic)
- [web/AGENTS.md](web/AGENTS.md): pnpm workspace (Next.js + shared packages)

When working in `apps/core/`, `apps/cli/`, or `web/`, load the matching `AGENTS.md` alongside this one.

## What is OpenMagpie

An open-source semantic listener. Tell it what to listen for; it picks out what matters from any stream and learns over time.

Three things stay pluggable across the codebase:
- **Connectors** (Reddit, GitHub, GDocs, Slack, ...): yield typed `SourcePayload` subclasses from each source
- **Engines** (the Codex/Claude ACP bridge or another OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint; future keyword/other): BYO LLM that judges a `SourcePayload` for a semantic-filter action
- **Action kinds** (semantic_filter, extract, webhook, log, future keyword/Slack/email): the steps a Watch runs over each feed item -- three families: FILTER (gate the chain), EXTRACT (hydrate structured fields onto the run), DELIVER

The product is **only** a listener: watches, judges, learns, notifies. It does NOT auto-reply, post back to sources, run workflows, or generate new reports/analysis as a product surface. Exporting your OWN activity is in scope though -- e.g. `magpie activity export` dumping an action's runs (incl. extracted fields) to CSV is observability over data you already produced, not report generation. Scope test: if a feature isn't listening / learning / notifying (or surfacing what it already did), it's out.

## Naming (cross-cutting domain vocabulary)

- The unit of attention is a **`Watch`**: a subscription over a set of feeds plus an ordered chain of actions. "Listener" survives as the product pitch ("a Watch is a listener"), not a code-level node name.
- A polled item is a **`FeedItem`** (persisted Django row). The in-memory typed version a connector produces is a **`SourcePayload`** (Pydantic).
- A single action executing against one feed item is a **`WatchActionRun`** (the audit row), surfaced publicly (CLI + REST) as **`activity`** (the model name stays `WatchActionRun`; the unit is an "activity entry"). There is no `Event` / hit model; a successful filter is just a `WatchActionRun` that advanced the chain.
- **Resource names qualify by parent only when dependent.** A first-class entity, a hub other resources are addressed relative to, is named bare (`Watch`, `Feed`, `WatchAction`). A dependent record or component, meaningless apart from its parent, is qualified by it (a feed's items / sources, an action's activity / deliveries). This drives both REST route names ([apps/core/AGENTS.md](apps/core/AGENTS.md)) and CLI command nouns ([apps/cli/AGENTS.md](apps/cli/AGENTS.md)).
- Source connectors are named for the variant: **`RedditSubRedditConnector`** (kind=`"reddit_subreddit"`). Future Reddit variants get their own connector + kind.
- Payloads from sources are named for *what happened*: **`NewRedditPostPayload`** (`PAYLOAD_KIND="new_post"`).
- An action's typed result is a per-kind model: **`SemanticFilterResult`** (`{passed, score, reason}`), `WebhookResult`, `LogResult`.

## Cross-cutting code rules

- **State-machine values get a const object + derived type from the start.** No bare string literals in match arms or status checks. Python: `class Status(Enum): ...`. TypeScript: `const PHASE = {...} as const; type Phase = typeof PHASE[keyof typeof PHASE]`.
- **No em dashes, and no `--` as a stand-in for one.** Rewrite: commas, parens, or two sentences. Applies to UI text, comments, docs.
- **Shell scripts are POSIX `sh`.** `#!/bin/sh`, no bashisms (`[[ ]]`, `=~`, arrays, `local`, `set -o pipefail`, `${BASH_SOURCE}`, `< <(...)`). Everything in `scripts/` must pass `shellcheck -s sh` (enforced in pre-commit + CI).
- **Convention docs describe what to do.** No justifications, no historical context, no "we chose X because of Y." Forward-looking constraints are fine; past-decision narratives are not.
- **Branch names are `<type>/<kebab-slug>`.** Type is a Conventional-Commits prefix (`feat` | `fix` | `docs` | `refactor` | `test` | `chore` | `ci` | `perf` | `build` | `style` | `revert`); `main` is exempt. Enforced by `scripts/check-branch-name.sh` (pre-commit + CI). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the per-type meanings and the PR flow.
- **PR descriptions follow `What` → `How` → `Testing` → `Notes`.** `What` is the change and why; `How` is the approach, grouped by area (Backend / Web / Docs / ...) when it spans several; `Testing` states what you ran and what passed; `Notes` is optional (caveats, follow-ups, out-of-scope). Scaffolded by [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Stack

**Django + Postgres** (a `db` service in docker-compose). The app is a multi-writer pipeline (poll + trigger/drain/flush write concurrently), which SQLite's single-writer lock can't serve; Postgres' MVCC is required, not optional.

- Web: pnpm + Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind v4 + zod.
- CLI: Typer + httpx + Pydantic.

Deliberately deferred until concrete need:
- **Redis / Celery / Celery-beat** when async or scheduled work shows up
- **Garage** (S3-compatible blob storage; NOT MinIO) when we need blobs
- **Django admin**: `manage.py shell` or custom commands for v0

Do NOT proactively re-add deferred infra. Wait for a concrete need.

## Tooling preferences

Prefer OSS-aligned / community-governed tools over commercial-OSS hybrids with a history of license rugs.
- **Blob storage** (when needed): Garage, not MinIO
- **Type checker**: ty (not mypy unless ty proves insufficient)

## Releases & changelog

release-please owns versioning + the changelogs, generated from the
conventional-commit history, in TWO tracks: the product (`CHANGELOG.md` +
`version.txt`, tag `v<x.y.z>`) and the CLI (`apps/cli/CHANGELOG.md`, tag
`cli-v<x.y.z>` = the PyPI `openmagpie`). Each entry comes from a merged commit's
SUBJECT line.

- **The commit TYPE picks the section a reader sees.** Release notes are grouped
  into emoji sections (`changelog-sections` in `release-please-config.json`):
  ✨ Features (`feat`), 🐛 Bug Fixes (`fix`), ⚡ Performance (`perf`), ⏪ Reverts
  (`revert`), 📝 Documentation (`docs`). Everything else (`refactor`, `chore`, `ci`,
  `test`, `build`, `style`) is hidden, so those changes stay out of the notes
  entirely. Pick the type deliberately: it decides both the section and whether a
  change shows up at all.
- **A changelog entry says what the feature DOES for a user, not how it's built.**
  Lead with the capability ("a watch action that pulls fields you declare out of
  each item"); leave out internal types, migration notes, and engine internals
  (that's implementation). Frame the product track for a server/product reader, the
  CLI track for a CLI user.
- **Notes are authored on the FEATURE PR, not the release PR.** On a squash merge,
  GitHub sets the merge commit's subject from the PR TITLE (which becomes the
  one-line entry) and its body from the PR DESCRIPTION (appended under the entry as
  the detail). So a feature PR's title + `## What` ARE the release note, captured at
  merge time. The body EXPANDS the entry ("what it does and why"); it does not
  repeat it. This depends on the repo setting **"Default to PR title and description
  for squash merge commits"** being ON; without it the PR description never reaches
  the notes.
- **release-please OWNS `CHANGELOG.md` and the release branches**
  (`release-please--branches--main*`): it regenerates and force-pushes the changelog
  from the merged commits on every push to main. Do NOT author notes by editing
  `CHANGELOG.md` on a release branch, it gets clobbered. Fix wording on the FEATURE
  PR before merging (a merged subject can't be corrected without rewriting history).
  A last-minute polish on the release PR is possible but fragile, since the next
  merge to main re-runs release-please and overwrites it. The release PR is the ship
  button, not where you write notes.
- Prose follows the no-em-dash rule above.
