# redirects) so a public hostname that resolves to a private address,
# or a 302 to an internal target, is rejected at poll time as a

# single-tenant self-host where the operator might legitimately watch
# an internal feed; flip on for multi-tenant / public deployments.

# POSTs the failing URL to a FlareSolverr sidecar
# (https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) which runs headless
# Chrome in its own container, passes the JS challenge, and returns
# the real body. Empty default (no localhost / docker fallback baked
# into prod settings) ; dev seeds the docker-compose service name in
# `conf.settings.local`.
# ALSO backs the linked-article enrichment fallback (watches.actions._external):
# when the direct pinned-IP fetch hits a challenge wall, the article is retried
# through this sidecar. SECURITY: the sidecar egresses via a real browser, so the
# pinned-IP SSRF guard cannot apply; that path pre-validates the (untrusted) URL's
# host and refuses private-resolving hosts, but still trusts the sidecar's egress
# (a self-hosted, operator-opted-in service). Leave empty to disable both uses.

# operator can crank `LOG_LEVEL_FEEDS=DEBUG` without editing code.

# Django's own loggers are left at framework defaults via
