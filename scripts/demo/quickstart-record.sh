# Record assets/quickstart.gif with VHS: the real `curl | sh` quickstart, run
# in a throwaway ../demo directory (a sibling of this checkout) and montaged by
# scripts/demo/quickstart.tape. Deliberately NOT a make target: re-recording
# the README asset is a rare, maintainer-only act, not dev loop.
#
# The recording IS a full quickstart (clone, build, seed, score), so a take
# costs its full wall-clock and needs a clean slate. Preconditions enforced
# here, each with its remedy:
# - this checkout's stack and job tickers must be DOWN (the demo stack binds
#   the same host ports): make down-jobs && make down
# - ../demo must not exist (the bootstrap clones into it; a stale take would
#   re-enter an existing checkout and record an update, not an install)
# - the first reachable local /v1 endpoint must list qwen2.5:7b: the tape
#   accepts the quickstart's detected default URL and types that model id, and
#   a typed id missing from the list re-prompts and derails the take
# - vhs on PATH (https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs ; brew install vhs),
#   plus the quickstart's own tools (git, curl, docker, uv), checked up front
#   so a missing one fails here and not minutes into the take
#
# The demo stack runs as compose project openmagpie-demo (exported below, and
# inherited by the shell VHS records), so its containers and volumes never
# touch this checkout's. After the take it is torn down WITH volumes (a retake
# must hit a fresh DB); the ../demo checkout is left behind for inspection and
# must be removed before the next take.
#
# POSIX sh, like the rest of scripts/ (shellcheck -s sh in pre-commit + CI).
