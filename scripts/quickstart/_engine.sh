# Engine (OpenAI-compatible LLM) setup for the quickstart, SOURCED by run.sh
# (after _lib.sh, whose env_get_default/env_set these build on). Kept out of
# run.sh so the orchestrator stays a readable top-to-bottom flow. Just function
# definitions, no side effects.
#
# The engine talks to any backend over the OpenAI /v1 API, so setup only needs an
# endpoint + (maybe) a key + a validate call - no backend identification.
#
# POSIX sh, like the rest of scripts/ (shellcheck -s sh in pre-commit + CI).

# Validate + list models at $1 (optional API key $2): echo the model ids one per
# line, empty on any failure (unreachable/auth/none). The probe lives in the
# Python module engine.scripts.probe (httpx-only, Django-free); the shell shells
# out so it never re-implements it. Runs from apps/core so `-m engine.scripts.probe`
# resolves the `engine` package (callers are cd'd to repo root). Stderr is parsed
# for the probe's `probe: <reason>` diagnostic line (emitted on any failure) and
# stashed in the global ENGINE_PROBE_REASON so the caller can surface WHY the
# probe came back empty - "no LLM reached" alone can hide an authentication
# or model-configuration failure. uv's own chatter (sync
# progress, warnings) is swallowed; it isn't actionable here.
