# OpenMagpie local quickstart, runnable straight from a fresh machine:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://openmagpie.ai | sh
#
# Clones the repo and hands off to scripts/quickstart/run.sh (build the stack,
# migrate, install the local CLI, seed an example feed + watch, install git
# hooks). Local development only; OpenMagpie is BYO-LLM, so run.sh points at an
# OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint you control (the local Codex/Claude ACP bridge,
# vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp, or a hosted API) - it detects a local one or prompts.
#
# POSIX sh (no bashisms), like every scripts/*.sh (shellcheck -s sh enforces it
# in pre-commit + CI), so the whole `curl ... | sh` flow is bash-free.
#
# Pre-clone, this checks only for git (needed to fetch the repo). The full
# prerequisites checklist (supported OS, Docker + Compose, uv) runs right after
# the clone, in scripts/quickstart/preflight.sh, so there's one styled checklist
# instead of two. Guide-only: it never installs anything; missing tools get
# install instructions. (make is NOT needed for the quickstart.)
#
# Env overrides. When piping, prefix the `sh`, NOT the `curl` (the assignment
# binds to the command it precedes), e.g.:
#   curl -fsSL https://openmagpie.ai | OPENMAGPIE_BRANCH=feature sh
#   OPENMAGPIE_DIR     where to clone (default: ./openmagpie under the current
#                      directory; prompts when run interactively)
#   OPENMAGPIE_BRANCH  branch or tag to check out (default: the latest published
#                      release, falling back to main when there's none / lookup
#                      fails; set OPENMAGPIE_BRANCH=main for the bleeding edge)
#   OPENMAGPIE_SSH=1   clone over SSH instead of HTTPS
# DAYS / SKIP_DATA_SEED pass through to the seed as well (inherited down to
# seed.sh), e.g. DAYS=7 sh:
#   DAYS               first-tick backfill window (default 1)
#   SKIP_DATA_SEED=1   create the account only, no feed/watch
